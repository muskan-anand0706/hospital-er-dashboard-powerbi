# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard | Power BI, Power Query

**Brief One Line Summary:**  
Interactive dashboard to analyze patient flow, wait times, and ER operational metrics.

**Overview:**  
Developed a multi-page Power BI dashboard using hospital data (~9,000–10,000 records) to visualize patient flow, wait times, and workload patterns.

**Problem Statement:**  
Emergency rooms often face high patient volume and resource constraints. This project aims to identify peak periods, operational bottlenecks, and trends to support better resource planning.

**Dataset:**  
Publicly available hospital ER dataset (raw and cleaned data files included).

**Tools and Technologies:**  
Power BI | Power Query | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization

**Methods:**  
- Basic data cleaning and type corrections using Power Query  
- Multi-page dashboard with interactive filters to explore trends over time  
- Visualization of patient flow, wait times, and workload distribution

**Key Insights:**  
- Identified peak patient periods and operational pressure points  
- Visualized trends in patient wait times across different times/days  
- Insights can assist in resource planning and workload management

**Dashboard / Output:**  
Multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard with:  
- Filters for time periods to explore patient flow trends  
- Visualizations of wait times, patient count, and workload distribution  
- Pages highlighting operational metrics and peak periods

**How to Run this Project:**  
1. Open the provided Power BI file (.pbix)  
2. Explore each dashboard page using interactive filters  
3. Review patient flow trends, wait times, and workload insights

**Results & Conclusion:**  
- Clear understanding of patient flow and ER operational metrics  
- Identified periods of high pressure to support resource planning  
- Dashboard provides actionable insights for hospital management

**Future Work:**  
- Integrate predictive analytics to forecast patient volumes  
- Include analysis of patient outcomes and resource utilization  
- Drill-through reports for department-wise or shift-wise insights
